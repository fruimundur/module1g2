            <p>CSS - and HTML - are the building blocks of any website. While CSS is the foundation, or the sceleton, of a website, then CSS is what 
               makes it look aesthetic. If you're interested in learning web development, you need to master the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>While I'm still pretty shit at it myself, this fake poster is an advert for me offering CSS lessons for beginners!</p>
            <p>The topics I will be covering, after the basic fundamentals, are the Box Model, Flexbox and Grid Layout.</p>
